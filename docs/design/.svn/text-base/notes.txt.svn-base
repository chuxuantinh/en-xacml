One of the important thing that need to be considered is, how to design an identity (user, group and so on)
management system that has ability to manage millions of identities, and allow 20 thousands of sessions.

[Management]
identities                    : 1,000,000
resources                     :    20,000

[Runtime]
sessions (ATN or (ATN & ATZ)) :    20,000
policies                      :    20,000
